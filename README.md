A Collection of my lab work 
Hi, I'm John Idogo, a Cybersecurity Analyst showcasing my lab work to support my job applications
## Projects
- [Lab 1 Objective:Introduction to Log Analysis) - This project showcases my foundational skills in log analysis for security monitoring. Through this lab, I learned to generate and collect logs on Windows and Linux systems, analyzing them to identify potential security incidents. By exploring log data, I developed an understanding of how SOC analysts leverage logs to detect threats, strengthening my ability to contribute to cybersecurity operations in roles focused on incident detection and response.
- [Lab 2 Objective:Windows Security Logs Analysis) - This project demonstrates my ability to analyze Windows Security Logs to identify and investigate security-related events. Through this lab, I developed hands-on skills in exploring logs to detect critical system activities, such as login attempts and user account changes, which are essential for identifying potential security threats. By completing this analysis, I gained practical experience in log analysis, enhancing my cybersecurity skill set for roles requiring threat detection and incident response
- [Lab 3 Objective: Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis) -This project demonstrates my proficiency in analyzing Windows PowerShell Logs to identify suspicious or malicious activities. Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience in exploring PowerShell-related events to detect potentially harmful commands that may indicate an attack or system compromise. By completing this analysis, I strengthened my ability to perform log-based threat detection, preparing me for cybersecurity roles focused on incident investigation and response.
- [Lab 4 Objective: Network-Based Attack Detection Using UFW) -This project showcases my ability to simulate and detect network-based attacks using UFW logs on a Linux system. In this lab, I conducted an HTTP port scan from a Kali Linux attacker machine and analyzed the resulting ufw.log entries on the victim machine to identify scan attempts. Through this exercise, I developed practical skills in configuring UFW for attack detection and interpreting log data, enhancing my expertise in network security monitoring for cybersecurity roles focused on threat identification and response.
- [Lab 5 Objective: Linux Auth Log Analysis) -This project demonstrates my ability to detect SSH brute force attacks by analyzing Linux authentication logs. Through this lab, I simulated an SSH brute force attack and analyzed /var/log/auth.log to identify patterns of multiple failed login attempts. By completing this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in recognizing malicious login activity, enhancing my skills in log analysis and threat detection for cybersecurity roles focused on securing Linux systems.
